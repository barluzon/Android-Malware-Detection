## Android-Malware-Detection
Implementation of Sec-SVM classifier based on the article "Yes, Machine Learning Can Be More Secure! A Case Study on Android Malware Detection"
The goal is to achieve good classification results in a safe manner according to the article.
### Dataset
3 JSON files that combined to 1 CSV (More than 8000 APK files with 25000 features)
### Models
The data is devided into 80% train and 20% test.
There is 3 models you can choose:
sec_svm_model_1000 - 1000 choosen features
sec_svm_model_3000 - 3000 choosen features
sec_svm_model_10000 - 10000 choosen features
You can see which features were chosen in 'select_features' folder.

### Create Model
You have 3 options (depends on your csv/JSON file):
create_model:
variables you need to change: dataset_path_malwares, dataset_path_benign.
create_model_csv:
variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.
create_model_after_vecotorized(if your csv file is already vectorized):
variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.

### How to run?
Put all the files and folders(except 'tests') inside folder named 'tool'.

python3 create_model_after_vectorized.py (or the other option you want).

python3 classifier.py ../tests  - put 1 APK file inside 'tests' folder, after you will run the command it will generate tests.json file,
will do some manipulation on the data, run the model and will predict 'Benign' or 'Malware'.
(1 APK file at a time and you will need to delete APK file from 'tests', and the tests.json file if you want to check another app).

python3 validation.py - If you have vectorized dataset with labels and you want to check accuracy/recall of the models.
Variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.
