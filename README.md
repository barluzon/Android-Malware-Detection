## Android-Malware-Detection
Implementation of Sec-SVM classifier based on the article "Yes, Machine Learning Can Be More Secure! A Case Study on Android Malware Detection".<br />
Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08996.pdf<br />
The goal is to achieve good classification results in a safe manner according to the article.
### Dataset
3 JSON files that combined to 1 CSV (More than 8000 APK files with more than 25000 features)
### Models
The data is devided into 80% train and 20% test.<br />
There is 3 models you can choose:<br />
sec_svm_model_1000 - 1000 choosen features<br />
sec_svm_model_3000 - 3000 choosen features<br />
sec_svm_model_10000 - 10000 choosen features<br />
You can see which features were chosen in 'select_features' folder.

### Create Model
You have 3 options (depends on your csv/JSON file):<br />
create_model:<br />
variables you need to change: dataset_path_malwares, dataset_path_benign.<br />
create_model_csv:<br />
variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.<br />
create_model_after_vecotorized(if your csv file is already vectorized):<br />
variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.<br />

### How to run?
Put all the files and folders(except 'tests') inside folder named 'tool'.<br />

python3 create_model_after_vectorized.py (or the other option you want).<br />

python3 classifier.py ../tests  - put 1 APK file inside 'tests' folder, after you will run the command it will generate tests.json file,<br />
will do some manipulation on the data, run the model and will predict 'Benign' or 'Malware'.<br />
(1 APK file at a time and you will need to delete APK file from 'tests', and the tests.json file if you want to check another app).<br />

python3 validation.py - If you have vectorized dataset with labels and you want to check accuracy/recall of the models.<br />
Variable you need to change: dataset_path_csv.
